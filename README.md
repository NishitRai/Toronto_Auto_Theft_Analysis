# About This Project
This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for a capstone project focused on analyzing public safety and geographic patterns in Toronto. The project leverages spatial data — including police division boundaries and neighborhood definitions — to explore trends, visualize incidents, and support data-driven decision-making.

🎯 Objectives
- Integrate and visualize GeoJSON boundary data for Toronto neighborhoods and police divisions
- Perform spatial analysis to uncover patterns in public safety metrics
- Build interactive maps and dashboards to communicate insights effectively
- Demonstrate proficiency in geospatial data handling, Python, and data storytelling

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, GeoPandas, Folium, Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Toronto Open Data Portal for sourcing public datasets
